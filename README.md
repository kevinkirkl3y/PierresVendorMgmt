# Pierres Vendor Management System

#### _C# Basic Web Applications for Epicodus 12.18.2020_

#### by _**Kevin Kirkley**_

## Description
  Pierre's Bakery is a fine purveyor of pastries and baguettes. They serve a variety of wholesale clients throughout the city. With that demand, Pierre requires a program to keep his vendor orders organized. This program allows the user to create profiles for each vendor they serve. Each vendor category then contains all of the orders placed by that vendor.
